#### **What is the goal of creating Cowboy.**

Cowboy is a side project that we created, the goal of creating this was to make a simple app people could easily dissect, which would allow them to see what ruby can do and also allow them to understand the simplicity of creating things like this.

#### **<u>How to start the app</u>**

Note - please install colorize with ```gem install colorize``` this is a gem used which gave our app some color.

make sure to be on the terminal of where the app folder is currently then;
to start the app simply run ```ruby index.rb```



#### <u>How to play the game.</u>

The game is pretty simple to understand we have 2 players and each turn a player chooses where to stand and where to shoot the goal of the game is to shoot where the player is standing.

<u>So let's break it down</u>
we allow the users to choose a name to make it feel more personal.

Player 1 then will select where to shoot.

Player 2 has to then decide on where to stand.

If the player shooting misses the the player standing will now have a turn to shoot.

and the other player must choose where to stand.

If the player does end up getting shot, there will be a short animation that will lead to the fatality. and will be awarded with the winning screen.

It will also allow you to play again if you press enter.
